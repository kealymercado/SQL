#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:

track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,

loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL
